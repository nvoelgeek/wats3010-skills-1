      <p>Let us consider for a moment what most of the trouble and anxiety which I have referred to is about, and how much
        it is necessary that we be troubled, or, at least, careful. It would be some advantage to live a primitive and
        frontier life, though in the midst of an outward civilization, if only to learn what are the gross necessaries of
        life and what methods have been taken to obtain them; or even to look over the old day-books of the merchants, to
        see what it was that men most commonly bought at the stores, what they stored, that is, what are the grossest
        groceries. For the improvements of ages have had but little influence on the essential laws of manâ€™s existence; as
        our skeletons, probably, are not to be distinguished from those of our ancestors

      <article><p> I cannot believe that our factory system is the best mode by which men may get clothing. The condition of the
          operatives is becoming every day more like that of the English; and it cannot be wondered at, since, as far as I
          have heard or observed, the principal object is, not that mankind may be well and honestly clad, but,
          unquestionably, that corporations may be enriched. In the long run men hit only what they aim at. Therefore,
          though they should fail immediately, they had better aim at something high.
